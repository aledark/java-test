/*
*
*	a. What endpoints and methods would you enable for creation, reading, modification and deletion?
*		In the case of endpoints, the following will be defined for each model:
*
*		GET /consessionaires
*		GET /consessionaires?id=1
*		POST /consessionaires
*		PUT /consessionaires/1
*
*   		GET for reading resources.
*   		POST or PUT for creating new resources.
*   		PUT and PATCH for updating existing resources.
*		DELETE for deleting existing resources.
*
*		For DELETE type operations we have to be very careful given the nature of the relationships, 
*		so other methods are needed to validate that it is done correctly.
*
*
*	b. How can be a hierarchical access to enable the front-end for querying devices belonging to a specific bus?
*	
*		First, we must know which bus we want to query the devices from -> GET /buses
*		Having the clarity, we can use -> GET /devices?busId=2
*		Then, the hierarchical access consists of buses->devices
*
